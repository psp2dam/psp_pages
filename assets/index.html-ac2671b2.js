There are many libraries to work with the most common services. In this unit we are going to focus on the FTP (file transfer), SMTP service (mail sending) and POP3/IMAP (mail reading).</p><p>In addition, there are other approaches, also based on the client-server architecture that allow access to systems. Among the most used, is what is called <code>Rest API</code>, which is still a service over <em>HTTP</em> that allows you to interact with the backend of the systems, no matter the architecture and languages used in the frontend.</p><p>We are going to analyze in this unit other approaches such as queue systems, based on the MQ protocol, or <code>serverless systems</code> offered by the main cloud computing platforms (Azure Functions, AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions).</p><h2 id="goals" tabindex="-1">Goals</h2><p>Goals of this unit:</p><ul><li>Use Java libraries to use the most important TCP/IP application protocols.</li><li>Test network communication services.</li><li>Allow cloud operations easily.</li><li>Create applications that allow asynchronous communication between clients and between clients and servers.</li></ul>',9),n=[a];function r(c,l){return t(),s("div",null,n)}const h=e(i,[["render",r],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
