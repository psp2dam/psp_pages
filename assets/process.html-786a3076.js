Concurrent programming</h2><p>In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program to be executed out-of-order or at the same time simultaneously.</p><p>This allows for <code>parallel</code> execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in <code>multi-processor and multi-core</code> machines.</p><p>The concept of concurrent computing is frequently confused with the related but distinct concept of parallel computing, although both can be described as <em>multiple processes executing during the same period of time</em>.</p><ul><li>In parallel computing, execution occurs at the same physical instant: for example, on separate processors of a multi-processor machine, with the goal of speeding up computations.</li><li>This parallel computing is impossible on a <code>one-core single processor</code>, as only one computation can occur at any instant (during any single clock cycle). By contrast, concurrent computing consists of process lifetimes overlapping, but execution need not happen at the same instant. The goal here is to model processes in the outside world that happen concurrently using <code>multitask</code>.</li></ul><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Concurrency vs parallelism"></p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Concurrency</p><p>By and large, both previously described scenarios are gonna be referred to as <strong>concurrency</strong>.</p></div><h3 id="what-for" tabindex="-1">What for?</h3><p>The Real World is Massively Complex</p><ul><li>In the natural world, many complex, interrelated events are happening at the same time, yet within a temporal sequence.</li><li>Compared to serial computing, parallel computing is much better suited for modeling, simulating and understanding complex, real world phenomena.</li></ul><p>Imagine modeling these serially: climate change, rush hour traffic, weather forecast, galaxy formation, ...</p><p>Main Reasons for Using Parallel Programming</p><ul><li>Save time and money. In theory, throwing more resources at a task will shorten its time to completion, with potential cost savings. <ul><li>Parallel computers can be built from cheap, commodity components.</li></ul></li><li>Solve larger and more complex problems. Many problems are so large and/or complex that it is impractical or impossible to solve them using a serial program, especially given limited computer memory. <ul><li><em>Grand Challenge Problems</em> (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Challenge) requiring petaflops and petabytes of computing resources.</li><li>Web search engines/databases processing millions of transactions every second</li></ul></li><li>Take advantage of non-local resources. Using compute resources on a wide area network, or even the Internet when local compute resources are scarce or insufficient. <ul><li><em>SETI@home</em> (setiathome.berkeley.edu) has over 1.7 million users in nearly every country in the world. (May, 2018).</li></ul></li><li>Make better use of underlying parallel hardware. Modern computers, even laptops, are parallel in architecture with multiple processors/cores. <ul><li>Parallel software is specifically intended for parallel hardware with multiple cores, threads, etc.</li><li>In most cases, serial programs run on modern computers &quot;waste&quot; potential computing power.</li></ul></li><li>Increase security. Each task can be isolated in a different process, so debug and check the security, even finishing it when it&#39;s not working properly, can be done without hanging the whole system.</li></ul><p>Historically, parallel computing has been considered to be &quot;the high end of computing&quot;, and has been used to model difficult problems in many areas of science and engineering. Today, commercial applications provide an equal or greater driving force in the development of faster computers. These applications require the processing of large amounts of data in sophisticated ways. For example:</p><p>New hardware environments can be classified in terms of:</p><ul><li>Microprocessor with many cores sharing system memory.</li><li>Multiprocessor systems with shared memory</li><li>Distributed systems and cloud services.</li></ul><h3 id="process-communication-and-synchronization" tabindex="-1">Process communication and synchronization</h3><p>The concurrent running of many processes may suppose the collaboration of some of them in order to complete a common task, while they can also be competing for system resources.</p><p>In both cases it is compulsory to add communication and synchronization techniques for the processes.</p><div class="custom-container info"><p class="custom-container-title">Concurrent programming</p><p>Concurrent programming and PSP is just about that, the knowledge of these <strong>communication and synchronization techniques</strong>.</p></div><p>When thinking about the way a process can communicate with each other, there are two main options:</p><ul><li>Message passing: It&#39;s commonly used when processes are running on different devices. They exchange information following a protocol previously set and agreed by the parts.</li><li>Shared resources / memory: It&#39;s only available when both processes are running on the same device and allows process synchronization based on a shared resource value or state.</li></ul><p>We can also classify the communication by the synchronization the processes use during the message passing process:</p><ul><li>Synchronous communication happens when messages can only be exchanged in real time. It requires that the transmitter and receiver are present in the same time and/or space. Sender is blocked until receiver gets the message. Both processes are synchronized at the reception time. <ul><li>Examples of synchronous communication are phone calls or video meetings.</li></ul></li><li>Asynchronous communication happens when information can be exchanged independent of time. It doesn’t require the recipient’s immediate attention, allowing them to respond to the message at their convenience. Sender continues with it processing just after delivering the message to the receiver, not being blocked. <ul><li>Examples of asynchronous communication are emails, online forums, and collaborative documents.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="_1-1-3-services-and-threads" tabindex="-1">1.1.3. Services and threads</h2><p>A program, as previously said, is a group of sentences (actions and checks) and a running workflow. The workflow line determines the execution order for the sentences, with dependency of the program structure and it&#39;s data.</p><p>Based on the number of workflow lines a program can have, processes are classified in terms of::</p><ul><li>Sequential: The have only one control workflow (monothread)</li><li>Concurrent: They have multiple control workflows (multithread).</li></ul><h3 id="sequential-program-von-neumann-architecture" tabindex="-1">Sequential program (Von Neumann architecture)</h3><p>The classical Von Neumann model of computation4 is a familiar model of sequential behavior.
