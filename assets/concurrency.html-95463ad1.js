Distributed systems</h2><blockquote><p>&quot;A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single. coherent system&quot;</p><p>&quot;Andrew S. Tanembaum&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This definition has several important aspects:</p><ul><li>The first one is that a distributed system consists of components (i.e., computers) that are autonomous.</li><li>A second aspect is that users (people or programs) think they are dealing with a single system. This means that one way or the other the autonomous components need to collaborate. How to establish this collaboration lies at the heart of developing distributed systems</li></ul><p>The most known and famous example of distributed system is <code>the Internet</code>. The Internet is seen by the users as a single huge documents repository, that is, a single system able to provide almost any information or service. Notwithstanding the above, we know that is made up of millions of devices located all over the world and interconnected.</p><p>It began with the need to share resources. Actually the state-of-the-art on these systems are <code>Cloud Computing</code> or cloud services. It&#39;s said that a distributed system is where software components are distributed on a network and they communicate and coordinate with each other by using message passing.</p><p>Let&#39;s concentrate on important characteristics of distributed systems:</p><ul><li>Concurrency. Allows running multiple process in parallel.</li><li>Global watch independency. Implies synchronization using messaging.</li><li>Scalability: distributed systems should also be relatively easy to expand or scale. This characteristic is a direct consequence of having independent computers, but at the same time, hiding how these computers actually take part in the system as a whole.</li><li>Fault tolerance: A distributed system will normally be continuously available, although perhaps some parts may be temporarily out of order.</li></ul><h2 id="_1-2-3-advantages-and-disadvantages" tabindex="-1">1.2.3.
