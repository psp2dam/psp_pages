Secure programming techniques</h1><p>Cryptography is a term derived from the Greek word <em>kryptos</em> which means hidden and <em>grafos</em> which means writing. The objective of cryptography is to hide the meaning of a message by encrypting or encoding the message.</p><p>Cryptographic techniques are used to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of information. Cryptography is used to protect information in transit or stored in a computer system.
